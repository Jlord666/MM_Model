Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe! -- A. Einstein

This repository contains matlab code for Michaelisâ€“Menten model for the 2-step enzymatic raction without product inhibition. I am still working that so please
be patient.

dXdT.m:

A program that models MM kinetics (some differencial equations).

pass_data.m:

A program that iterates dXdT by giving different initial conditions.
